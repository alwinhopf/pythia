 IPEXP   YEAR DOY =    0   0
 Photosynthesis method (PHOTO in FILEX) has been changed                       
 from "L" to "C" for compatibility with crop model, MZCER.

 Residue application   1                                                       
 Neither residue incorporation percentage nor depth specified. Applied residues
 will remain on surface until a tillage event is specified.                    

 RPLACE  YEAR DOY = 2010 121
 Default N concentration used for one or more residue applications             

 SOILNI  YEAR DOY = 2010 121
 N content of residue was changed from value in initial conditions             
   section of experiment file to maintain allowable C:N ratio.                 
   - Previous crop code                 :    MZ                                
   - Recommended N content for surface residue (%):   1.1                      
   - Value read from file               : 0.800%                               
   - Value changed to                   : 0.880%                               
 To change allowable N content, modify SCN parameter                           
   in RESCH048.SDA file.
